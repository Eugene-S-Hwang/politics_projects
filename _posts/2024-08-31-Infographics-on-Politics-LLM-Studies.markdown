These are some inforgraphics that I made of three studies that I read that combines political science and LLMs.

The first study is "Large Language Models and Political Science" by Mitchell Linegar, Rafal Kocielnik, and R. Michael Alvarez. It is a study on the efficacy of using large language models for political analysis in a general sense.

The second study is "LLMs in Political Science: Heralding a New Era of Visual Analysis" by Yu Wang. It studied how accurate images were in analyzing political images, such as object identification.

The third study is "How to Train Your Stochastic Parrot: Large Language Models for Political Texts" by Joseph T. Ornstein, Elise N. Blasingame, and Jake S. Tuscott. This researched four main ways of using LLMs for political analysis and outlined its accuracy.

Below are the infographics that I created for each study:
